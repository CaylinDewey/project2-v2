# Game of Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard
## User Experience
- A <b>user-centered</b> approach was taken with the design of an interactive sight for this game.  
- The user should be able to start the game, <i><b>and save scores on a scoreboard</i></b> within a short period of time.
- The site should be <b>future-proofed</b> to accomodate <b>scalability</b> but keep the navigation of the site consistent for the user - regardless of growth and expansion.  

### User Stories UX
#### First Time Visitor Goals
- As a user, I want to be able to start this game quickly and generate a score. 
- I want to be able to clearly see who won and why. 
- I want easy access to the rules, so that I can check how scores are awarded.
- The score should be saved on a scoreboard if I choose.  
- The scores should be tallied up for me.
- I should be able to reset the game at any point.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- The same basic structure will allow for consistency and predictability for returning users.
- The rules are on display with each game making indirect visibility key to learning the rules. This in-turn should generate indirectly toward the investement of the user.
- The rules are visible, generic and easy to learn making the game accessible and relevant.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- An easy return to a familiar game is important.
- The user can make use of the score board or not - the game can be played either way.

## Features
- The site is responsive on all device sizes.

### Existing Features
#### Main Headings
- The headings are clear and without clutter.

#### Easy to Navigate
- It is easy to navigate - you simply work your way top-down through the options.

![Easy Navigation](assets/images/readme/display-reset-feature.png)

#### Rules
- The rules are visually indicated, giving a quick clear explanation at a glance.
- It can be accessed while playing by simply scrolling up - without losing scores or activating a new game.
- The rule resource is generic and easy to follow, making the game accessible globally to all genres and cultures.

![Rules Display](assets/images/readme/wikipedia-rules-clear-display.png)

#### Feedback Section
- The feedback section gives the user the option that was chosen, as well as the universe option that randomly was selected.  
- Both the rules and the feedback have words that indicate the choices for easy referencing.

![Feedback Section](assets/images/readme/display-clear-score-outcome.png)

#### Individual Game Scores with tally
- Transparency is enhanced by the clear way the scoring is awarded.
- Once a score is saved the tally is displayed for the new game to commence. 
- It is easily checked against the scoreboard since it only increases in increments of 1.
- This running total ensures that both individual game scores and a running total is made available to the user (generally used for drinking, volunteer and dare games).

![Game Score](assets/images/readme/display-clear-score-tally.png)

#### The Scoreboard
- The scoreboard keeps tally of the scores after each save. The results still display showing who was awarded the score. 
- With this save function it is easy to see when and how the scores increase and what the latest scores are. 

![Scoreboard](assets/images/readme/display-clear-scoreboard.png)

#### The Reset Button
- The reset button allows for a new set of scores to be stored.
- The user can store as many sets of scores as is needed.

#### 404 Page
- A 404 page was added to ensure that users could navigate back to the main page if they inadvertently landed somewhere else.

![Error-404](assets/images/readme/error-404-page.png)

#### Clear Buttons
- The buttons are highly visible - all in the same color. This makes playing predictable and easy. 
- The buttons changes color to blue, to show hovering and use.

![Clear Buttons Desktop](assets/images/readme/display-blue-button.png)

- On the mobile device the buttons are still easy to use. 

![Clear Buttons Mobile](assets/images/readme//display-clear-mobile.png)

#### Footer
- The footer displays copyright information.

### Features Left to Implement
- A multiple player option could be provided.
- Adverts for these services could also generate income.
- Pages with information about the origins of the game could lure users.  A spin off from this could be a sister quiz game.

## Design
### Color Scheme
The following palette was selected from [My Color Space](https://mycolor.space/)

![Color Palette](assets/images/readme/mycolor-palette.png)

### Typography
- The Raleway family of fonts was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) with sans-serif in case it doesn't import.

### Wireframes
- [FigmaJam](https://www.figma.com/) was used to create wireframes that will scale up easily for teamwork. 
- The site has been designed with an "easy to take in" style.
- Each stroke and click is efficient and intentional.
- There is no clutter or unnecessary information.

## Technologies Used
### Language
- HTML, CSS and Javascript was used.

## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control.
- [Github](https://github.com/) wa used to save and store files.
- [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) was used for screendumps.

## Testing
### Issues and Bugs
-  Initially a decision maker game was conceptualised but it proved too complicated to pull together, since it needed form reset functions and scoreboards.
- Valuable feedback from the mentor and peers, made it clear that there may be issues about users not actually understanding the game.  It was decided to convert current work to a game that would be well recognised and understood. 
- Simpler features could be used with manageable code that responds without too many complications. 
- The bulk of the code was converted to a game of rock, paper, scissors, spock and lizard. 
- A new repository was used so that none of the old code and text was carried through to the game.

### Validator Results 
- The W3C HTML Validator were used and Index.html passed the test  [W3C HTML Validtor](https://validator.w3.org/).
