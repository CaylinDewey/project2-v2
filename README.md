# Game of Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard
## User Experience
- A <b>user-centered</b> approach was taken with the design of an interactive sight for this game.  
- The user should be able to start the game, <i><b>and save scores on a scoreboard</i></b> within a short period of time.
- The site should be <b>future-proofed</b> to accomodate <b>scalability</b> but keep the navigation of the site consistent for the user - regardless of growth and expansion.  

### User Stories UX
#### First Time Visitor Goals
- As a user, I want to be able to start this game quickly and generate a score. 
- I want to be able to clearly see who won and why. 
- I want easy access to the rules, so that I can check how scores are awarded.
- The score should be saved on a scoreboard if I choose.  
- The scores should be tallied up for me.
- I should be able to reset the game at any point.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
- The same basic structure will allow for consistency and predictability for returning users.
- The rules are on display with each game making indirect visibility key to learning the rules. This in-turn should generate indirectly toward the investement of the user.
- The rules are visible, generic and easy to learn making the game accessible and relevant.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
- An easy return to a familiar game is important.
- The user can make use of the score board or not - the game can be played either way.

## Features
- The site is responsive on all device sizes.

#### Footer
- The footer displays copyright information.

### Features Left to Implement
- A multiple player option could be provided.
- Adverts for these services could also generate income.
- Pages with information about the origins of the game could lure users.  A spin off from this could be a sister quiz game.
- Social media buttons and feeds can promote content and increase engagement.

## Design
### Color Scheme
The following palette was selected from [My Color Space](https://mycolor.space/)

![Color Palette](assets/images/readme/mycolor-palette.png)

### Typography
- The Raleway family of fonts was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) with sans-serif in case it doesn't import.

### Wireframes
- [FigmaJam](https://www.figma.com/) was used to create wireframes that will scale up easily for teamwork. 
- The site has been designed with an "easy to take in" style.
- Each stroke and click is efficient and intentional.
- There is no clutter or unnecessary information.

## Technologies Used
### Language
- HTML, CSS and Javascript was used.

## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control.
- [Github](https://github.com/) wa used to save and store files.
- [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html) was used for screendumps.

## Testing
### Issues and Bugs
-  Initially a decision maker game was conceptualised but it proved too complicated to pull together, since it needed form reset functions and scoreboards.
- Valuable feedback from the mentor and peers, made it clear that there may be issues about users not actually understanding the game or what it should be used for.  It was decided to convert current work to a game that would be well recognised and understood. 
- Simpler features could be used with manageable code that responds without too many complications. 
- A new repository was used so that none of the old code and text was carried through to the game.
- The bulk of the html, js, css and readme file was converted to a game of rock, paper, scissors, spock and lizard. It was much easier to test and responded well from the onset.

### Validator Results 
- The W3C HTML Validator were used and Index.html passed the test after a few tags were fixed.  [W3C HTML Validtor](https://validator.w3.org/).

![Page validation result](/assets/images/readme/validator-html-results.png)

- The W3C CSS Validator was used and Style.css passed the test after an unused style section for a div was removed. [W3C CSS Validtor](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

![CSS validation result](/assets/images/readme/validator-css-results.png)

### Jshint Testing
- A few errors were found with variables that were not being used but have been removed succesfully and no errors are found.
